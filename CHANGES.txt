Renata Dokmanovic says goodbye to the Yahoo YamahaDX forum.
She has helped many DX users and has had an important role during the development
of DX/TXconvert. This release is dedicated to her:
- -R or --Renata commandline option is a shortcut for --random=0
- 3rd party news: the official python-rtmidi-0.3.1a (or newer) downloads from
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rtmidi/
  should now work nicely with DX/TXconvert, also on Windows.
- MIDI in the GUI version gives mysterious problems, if run by pythonw.exe on Windows.
  They are now named dxconvert-gui.py and txconvert-gui.py again. (reported by Paul Deco)
- bugfix: unassigned variable "channel" when no channel selected in GUI.

2.1.1 (20130122)
