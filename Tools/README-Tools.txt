The tools in the Tools directory
================================

General usage:

All the commandline tools in this directory use a similar commandline 
syntax:

Short options start with "-"

Long options start with "--"

All other options are used as INPUT files.

Wildcards are allowed for infiles.

Unless "-o OUTFILE" or "--outfile=OUTFILE" is used, outfile names are 
derived from infile names. Existing filenames are first copied to numbered 
backup files, and then overwritten. (dx7iisyx2fd.py works a little different)
 
TIP: When using multiple input files, I recommend NOT to use the -o option.

Use the -h option for specific help.


syx2mid.py: 

A tool to convert SysEx files (usually, but not always, with .syx 
extension) to Standard MIDI files with the same content.

mid2syx.py: 

A tool to extract SyxEx information from MIDI files.

qr2syx.py: 

A tool to convert QR code images for the Yamaha Reface synths to SysEx 
files. This tool depends on Zbar for QR decoding. A binary called zbarimg 
(or zbarimg.exe on Windows) should be in your system PATH. You can find 
Zbar at http://zbar.sourceforge.net/

syx2qr.py: 

A tool to convert Yamaha Reface SysEx files to QR code images. This tool 
requires a python module named qrcode. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/qrcode 
You can use "pip install qrcode" for easy installation.

dx7iifd2syx.py: 

A tool to convert *.Ixx (xx is a number) from DX7IIFD floppy disks to 
normal SysEx files. Only the VOICE and PERFORMANCE data are converted. 
Other information, like microtuning tables, is ignored.

dx7iisyx2fd.py:
A tool to search data (VMEM, AMEM, PMEM, SYSTEM, MCT) from one or more DX7(II) sysex files 
and convert these into one DX7IIFD floppy disk file (*.Ixx) 

v50convert.py:

A tool to convert between V50 floppy disk files (*.Ixx, etc.) and SysEx files.

rymconvert.py:

A tool to convert 4-op FM patches from Yamaha to *.rym2612 patchfiles that can be loaded by
the "RYM2612 Iconic FM Synthesizer" VST plugin from Inphonik. This tool requires the DXconvert
python library installed in your PYTHONPATH. On my Linux system the DXconvert directory is 
currently installed in ~/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/ but this may vary depending on
your Python version and OS.
Rymconvert.py can import any fileformat that is supported by TXconvert.
